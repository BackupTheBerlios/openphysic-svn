This package contains 5 small example projects that illustrate AVR-LibC and GCC. All 
are tested with STK500 and the AT90S8515 shipped with the STK500.

Blinky:
A small LED chaser that deals with the GCC optimizer tendency to trach empty delay loops by
embedding volatile inline assembler code.

UART:
A small polled serial I/O project that illustrates the use of the stdio library functions
in AVR-LibC

UART-IntSIO:
A interrupt driver serial I/O project that uses circular buffers and uses the stdio library
functions.

Bitdefs:
Demonstrates the use of bitfields on I/O pins.

RC5:
Is a small polled RC5 receiver based on Atmel's application note, it demonstrates the AVR-GCC 
calling conventions.
