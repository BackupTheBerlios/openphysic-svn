This is a test software for the LCD panels
form shop.tuxgraphics.org. The software will scroll the string
"tuxgraphics.org" over the display.

The circuit diagram is documented in the file lcdschematic_gschem.pdf

You can also check the file lcd_hw.h against your circuit.

The main program is linuxlcdtest.c Feel free to use it and modify 
it for your own purposes.


Installation
------------
You need the GCC AVR programming software as described in
http://linuxfocus.org/English/November2004/article352.shtml

If you do not want to install the full environment then you can
use the pre-compiled avr code. You download it to the AVR uC with the
command:
make loadprebuild

To build and download the code use the command:
make load

Note: You will get some warnings "#warning "This header file is obsolete."
during compilation with avr-libc-1.4.X. This is because this code will 
also work with avr-libc-1.2.X

In both cases you need an installation of the uisp or avrdude 
programmer software.
Uisp needs the following kernel modules (2.4.x kernel):
modeprobe parport
modeprobe parport_pc
modeprobe ppdev

Changes:
--------
linuxlcdpanel-0.2 2005-01-27: first public version
linuxlcdpanel-0.3 2005-02-01: removed depricated PRG_RDB macro 
                              (replace by pgm_read_byte)

linuxlcdpanel-0.4 2005-02-07: RW is PB4 and RS is PB5. This is aligned
                              with the i2c thermometer and the schematic
			      included here.
			      Note: I had RS and RW swaped in older circuits.
			      Check the file lcd_hw.h against your circuit!

linuxlcdpanel-0.5 2005-02-26: Updated README file with new recommendation
                              regarding the 220 resistors.

linuxlcdpanel-0.6 2005-02-27: Changed wire connection to avoid the bit errors
                              during programming all together no matter what
			      type of parallel port is used.

linuxlcdpanel-0.7 2006-03-03: Modifed for gcc-4.0.x.
