Summary
-------

The m3D package is an extension to plain MetaPost designed
for 3 dimensional graphics. 

Licence
-------

Standard LaTeX licence even if I also like the
``Feel-free-to-send-me-a-postcard'' one.

Brief description of the files
------------------------------

*  mpinputs: MetaPost input files.
   o  m3Dplain.mp (the very core of m3D, reading
      it is better than read any manual)
   o  m3Dsty01.mp (initialize style parameters)
   o  m3Dlib01.mp (a small library where one cand find
      some common mathematical objects)
   o  One may add here new libraries or style files.

*  manual: a draft for a manual.
   o  m3Dmanual.pdf (to be read directly)
   o  m3Dmanual.tex (the text [plain-TeX]),
   o  m3Dmanual.mp  (illustrations, this helps also to understand
      how to use m3D),
   o  m3Dmanmac.tex (personal plain-TeX format)

*  trials: various things using m3D. Try them.

*  gallery: a small gallery of still or animated images.
