pstricks-add redefines a lot of the pstricks macros and uses the extended 
version of the keyval package. So be sure that you 
- pstricks-add depends on the pstricks.pro Version 1.00, 2005/09/18
  you can get it from http://perce.de/LaTeX/pstricks/ or CTAN
- load pstricks-add at last pstricks related package
- have installed xkeyval with the special pst-xkey
  (CTAN: tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/xkeyval/)
- do not load another package after pstricks-add, which loads
  the old keyval.sty or pst-key.tex

to the pstricks mailing list and has some more new features:
